# CMPE-257-MachineLearning-Project




1. Project Statement: We want to use machine learning for anomaly detection in blockchain. Training a model to identify unusual behavior in the network and detect potential security threats or fraudulent activities in near real-time. This enhances the security and stability of the blockchain network and makes the process of monitoring and securing it more efficient.
